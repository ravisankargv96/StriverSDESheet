After go through the striver A-Z sheet.

1.
	1.2 Build-up Logical Thinking -> complete this section.
		a. Generate every pattern image in the form of a grid, use ppt for it.
		Note: your image should exactly match with the patterns. -> yet to do.
		b. Focus on pattern solutions for some time. -> Done
		c. Grab the codes for it -> Done
		d. Check your code once in CN.

	1.4 Know Basic Maths -> Get all the codes in this section.
		a. Focus more on the algo part
		b. May be this codes will be helpful as helper methods.

	1.5. Learn Basic Recursion
		a. Generate Recursive tree.
		b. if mathematical formulae is included, conclude that formulae.
		c. if possible link the recursive tree to visual representation.
		d. Grab the codes.

3. Solve Problems on Arrays
	3.1 Easy:
		a. Focus on the algorithms, learn & practice them clearly.
		b. Write the code of brute -> optimal
		c. Group the problems according to the pattern.

16. Dynamic Programming
	ToDo:
		1. Generate the recursive trees
		2. make sure mathematical formulae should be derived from recursive approach
		3. If possible link the recursive tree to the visual representation of solving in layman terms.
		4. Must: Generate all the 4 possible solutions.

	16.2 1D DP
